# Focal Tech Touch FT8756 Controller Driver for Windows
In this repository you can find the FT8756 touch controller driver for Windows (KMDF).
This driver has been only tested with FT8756 controller found in Xiaomi Redmi Note 9S/Pro

This repository has been forked from https://github.com/theR4K/SynapticsTouch for the base and modified to work with Focal Tech digitizers, and again it was forked from https://github.com/gus33000/FocalTechTouch. Rest of the README is from the original fork.

## Disclaimer
This driver is not finished.
It contains debug code and might be missing comments as well.
Tracing has been replaced with KdPrintEx for various reason making development easier on some versions of Windows.

Have fun =)
